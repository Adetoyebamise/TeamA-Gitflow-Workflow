### This site is not secured because of the following missing headers.

- X-Frame Options
	 The Strict-Transport-Security header tells the browser whether the website can be framed or not. By preventing a browser from framing your site you can defend against attacks like clickjacking.
 
- X-Content-Type-Options
	This header stops a browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type and forces it to stick with the declared content-type.

- Permissions-Policy
	This is a header that allows a site to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser.

- Referrer-Policy
	The Referrer-Policy HTTP header controls how much referrer information (sent via the Referer header) should be included with requests. 

- Strict-Transport-Security
	The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP
